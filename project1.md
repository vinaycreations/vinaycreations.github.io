# Undergraduate Capstone Project: Building Models to Predict Ratings of Federal Judicial Nominees

## Introduction
- **Client:** University of Georgia - Political Science Department

- **Context:** When a vacancy arises in the Federal Judiciary, the President of the United States appoints a candidate to fill the position. The American Bar Association (ABA) assigns one of three ratings to the nominee: Not Qualified, Qualified, or Well Qualified.


## Objective
- The projectâ€™s focus is on determining the "quality" of the ratings given by the ABA to judicial nominees for the U.S. Court of Appeals.

- The objective is to investigate whether there are any correlations between the ABA ratings and various demographic or professional factors of the nominees, such as age/sex/race demographics, location, year appointed, past work experience, political party, etc.
