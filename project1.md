# Undergraduate Capstone Project: Building Models to Predict Ratings of Federal Judicial Nominees

## Introduction
- **Client:** University of Georgia - Political Science Department

- **Context:** When a vacancy arises in the Federal Judiciary, the President of the United States appoints a candidate to fill the position. The American Bar Association (ABA) assigns one of three ratings to the nominee: Not Qualified, Qualified, or Well Qualified.


## Objective
Analyze potential correlations between ABA ratings and various demographic or professional factors of judicial nomineesâ€”including age, sex, race, geographic location, appointment year, prior work experience, and political affiliation. Additionally, develop a predictive model to assess these relationships and forecast future ABA ratings for judicial appointments.

## Methodology
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR):** A statistical modeling technique designed for predicting an ordinal dependent variable, where the response categories have a meaningful order but unequal spacing. It extends logistic regression to handle ordered outcomes.

- **K-Modes Clustering:** A clustering algorithm that extends K-Means for categorical data by using mode-based updates instead of mean-based updates. It is used to identify distinct groups within a dataset based on shared characteristics.

## Results
### **Random Forest**
- The figure below illustrates a single decision tree.
- With each additional split, the decision tree becomes more specific, progressively improving the classification accuracy by isolating data points based on relevant feature thresholds.
- In this case study, the Random Forest Algorithm used 50,000 decision trees to train the model and make predictions.

- The confusion matrix below compares the predicted results from the Random Forest model to the actual data.
- The model achieved an overall accuracy of 72%, though it shows a bias towards predicting 'Well Qualified'.
- Since there were only three 'Not Qualified' ratings in the dataset, none of them appeared in the randomized test set, which influenced the results.
