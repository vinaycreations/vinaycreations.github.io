# Undergraduate Capstone Project: Building Models to Predict Ratings of Federal Judicial Nominees

## Introduction
- **Client:** University of Georgia - Political Science Department

- **Context:** When a vacancy arises in the Federal Judiciary, the President of the United States appoints a candidate to fill the position. The American Bar Association (ABA) assigns one of three ratings to the nominee: Not Qualified, Qualified, or Well Qualified.


## Objective
Analyze potential correlations between ABA ratings and various demographic or professional factors of judicial nomineesâ€”including age, sex, race, geographic location, appointment year, prior work experience, and political affiliation. Additionally, develop a predictive model to assess these relationships and forecast future ABA ratings for judicial appointments.

## Methodology
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR):** A statistical modeling technique designed for predicting an ordinal dependent variable, where the response categories have a meaningful order but unequal spacing. It extends logistic regression to handle ordered outcomes.

- **K-Modes Clustering:** A clustering algorithm that extends K-Means for categorical data by using mode-based updates instead of mean-based updates. It is used to identify distinct groups within a dataset based on shared characteristics.

## Results
Discuss the key insights or outcomes from the project and include any data visualizations or important findings.

## Future Improvements
Mention any ideas or plans for further improving the project or areas that could be expanded upon.
