# Trading Risk Analyzer Project

## üìöIntroduction
In recent years, retail short-term trading has surged in popularity, attracting many new traders eager to capitalize on market opportunities. However, a significant number enter the market with little to no understanding of risk management, proper position sizing, or trading psychology. Many overleverage their accounts, exposing themselves to excessive risk and often depleting their funds before they have a chance to develop the fundamental skills needed for long-term success.

To sustain a trading career, it is essential to not only assess risk on individual trades but also understand cumulative risk over weeks, months, and years. Without this awareness, traders may fall into emotional decision-making, leading to panic-driven trades and unexpected financial setbacks. Professional traders prioritize risk management above all else, ensuring they remain within their risk tolerance and focused on refining their strategies. Adopting this mindset is critical for any trader aiming for long-term profitability and consistency in the market.

## üéØObjective
- Develop a simulation-based tool that allows traders to assess their **long-term risk exposure** based on their past performance metrics.

- Traders input key statistics such as win percentage, average win/loss amount, and trade frequency, which the model uses to simulate thousands of potential trading scenarios.

- The tool provides visual outputs of possible account equity trajectories after 'n' trades, along with key risk metrics like:
  - Probability of ending in profit/loss
  - Confidence intervals for ending balances
  - Distribution of potential outcomes

- By shifting the focus from individual trade results to long-term risk assessment, traders can make informed decisions about position sizing and risk tolerance. This helps traders avoid unexpected large drawdowns, ensuring they stay within their risk parameters and maintain a professional, process-driven mindset.

## üß™Methodology
**Data Collection:** The data required for the tool must be collected by the user. This can be done either manually through tracking in an Excel sheet or by utilizing automated journaling software that pulls data directly from the user's brokerage account via API. The key inputs needed for the simulation are:
  - **Number of trades:** Total trades executed by the user during a given time period.
  - **Average realized reward-to-risk ratio:** The ratio between the average gain and average loss on each trade.
  - **Win percentage:** The percentage of trades that resulted in a profit.
 
**Model/Simulation Setup:**
- The model is based on a **Monte Carlo Simulation** approach, where thousands of trade scenarios are simulated using random sampling to estimate the distribution of potential outcomes for the trader's account equity.
- **Stochastic Modeling** is employed, where trade outcomes (win or loss) are randomly generated based on known probabilities (win probability), and account equity is adjusted based on these outcomes and the defined reward-to-risk ratio.
- The simulation considers **Expected Values** principles by using the win probability and the reward-to-risk ratio to model potential outcomes over a large number of trades.

**Outputs**:
- **Distribution of Simulated Outcomes:** A histogram displaying the distribution of all simulation results, helping traders visualize the spread of potential account equity outcomes.
- **Probability of Positive Equity:** The percentage of simulations that end with a final equity greater than the starting capital, representing the likelihood of achieving a profitable outcome.
- **Probability of Negative Equity:** The percentage of simulations that result in a final equity less than or equal to the starting capital, indicating the likelihood of a loss.
- **Largest Drawdown:** The maximum observed decline in equity during the simulation period, helping traders understand the worst-case scenario for their strategy.
- **Largest Gain:** The maximum observed gain in equity during the simulation, showing the best potential outcome in the simulations.
- **95% Confidence Interval:** The lower and upper bounds of final equity after all simulations, representing the range in which the trader can expect their final equity to fall with 95% confidence.
- **Maximum Consecutive Wins:** The highest number of consecutive wins observed in the simulations, providing insight into how often the trader can expect streaks of positive outcomes.
- **Maximum Consecutive Losses:** The highest number of consecutive losses observed in the simulations, highlighting the potential frequency of losing streaks and helping traders prepare for periods of drawdown.

## üìäExample: Implementation and Interpretation
**Step 1: Define Inputs**
```r
starting_capital = 10000  #Starting account balance of $10,000
risk_per_trade = 100  #Risk $100 per trade
win_probability = 0.40  #40% win rate
reward_to_risk_ratio = 2  #2:1 R/R ratio
num_trades = 100 #Number of Trades to Simulate
```

**Step 2: Run Simulation and Interpret Results**
