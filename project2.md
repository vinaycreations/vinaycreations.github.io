# Trading Risk Analyzer Project

## 📚Introduction
In recent years, retail short-term trading has surged in popularity, attracting many new traders eager to capitalize on market opportunities. However, a significant number enter the market with little to no understanding of risk management, proper position sizing, or trading psychology. Many overleverage their accounts, exposing themselves to excessive risk and often depleting their funds before they have a chance to develop the fundamental skills needed for long-term success.

To sustain a trading career, it is essential to not only assess risk on individual trades but also understand cumulative risk over weeks, months, and years. Without this awareness, traders may fall into emotional decision-making, leading to panic-driven trades and unexpected financial setbacks. Professional traders prioritize risk management above all else, ensuring they remain within their risk tolerance and focused on refining their strategies. Adopting this mindset is critical for any trader aiming for long-term profitability and consistency in the market.

## 🎯Objective
- Develop a simulation-based tool that allows traders to assess their **long-term risk exposure** based on their past performance metrics.

- Traders input key statistics such as win percentage, average win/loss amount, and trade frequency, which the model uses to simulate thousands of potential trading scenarios.

- The tool provides visual outputs of possible account equity trajectories after 'n' trades, along with key risk metrics like:
  - Probability of ending in profit/loss
  - Confidence intervals for ending balances
  - Distribution of potential outcomes

- By shifting the focus from individual trade results to long-term risk assessment, traders can make informed decisions about position sizing and risk tolerance. This helps traders avoid unexpected large drawdowns, ensuring they stay within their risk parameters and maintain a professional, process-driven mindset.
